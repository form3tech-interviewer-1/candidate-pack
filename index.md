# Hi. We're Form3

#### We are an award-winning cloud-native payment technology provider for financially regulated business. We connect those regulated businesses to payment schemes all over the world so that they can deliver amazing products for their customers. When you look around at how the world has changed, there’s this big divergence. The real economy has moved into a fast-paced, digital, real-time landscape; yet payments technology hasn’t quite kept pace. We are on a mission to redefine what a truly instant payment experience means. Why? Because we share an unwavering belief in an API driven payment future.

We are now a team of close to 250 amazing people and proudly partner with some of the most exciting and disruptive banks and FinTech’s in the world. We’ve rolled out into Europe and have ambitious plans to expand internationally. We are massively excited about our journey - and it’s only the beginning!

### Our love for technology

Though dotted across the UK and Europe, our love for cloud-native technology is what unites us. Technical excellence is our passion and we delight in using technology to continually improve our customer’s experience. When you combine that with operational excellence, magic happens.

### What we look for

Passion for cloud-native technologies, modern infrastructures and tools, and keeping up with the latest in engineering best practices. Skilled in designing and building distributed, scalable systems and know-how to apply data structure and algorithms to create amazing solutions. Polyglots who are comfortable picking up new technologies, choosing the best tool for the job and writing the right kind of tests. Above all, we’re looking for enthusiastic engineers who love working in a DevOps culture and value teamwork, different perspectives and blending disciplines.

### We love to pair!

For us pair programming is a way of life and it goes hand-in-hand with a remote-first culture. It allows us to onboard new colleagues, knowledge share, work through complex projects, commit to frequent releases and maintain high code quality.

There are no ‘strict’ rules for pair programming, and we empower our engineers to decide if they feel it’ll be beneficial on a particular problem. Depending on the project, our engineers spend between 50%-70% of their time pair programming.

Our engineers thrive in solving complex payment problems, pairing up the brightest minds to deliver technical excellence to our customers.
